# Network-Printer-Check-Automation
This script opens a set range of IP Printers automatically in new tabs (Chrome). When managing a certain amount of Printers it can get quite confusing as to which one you're opening, hope this helps.

You will need to PIP install webbrowser && time
Edit main.py and input IP addresses. 
Once ready, run main.py and chrome will open the IP addresses in new tabs automatically.
